# MLOps-GCP
Problem statement: Last year bank ran a campaign for targeting deposit customers with 10% success rate. This year bank is trying target customers better with minimum budget spend (i.e Data science & ML is the way!) to expland their cutomer credit lending divisons business. Here we tasked to build a classifer to identify whether the potential customer will accept or reject the loan based on different attributes.

Solution: We will develop an End-to End MLops pipeline solution for running bacth as well as online predection for the above problem statement. First, we will develop a XGboost based ML classifier, later on we will perform CI/CD of our model application leveraging Google cloud platform with predection serving applications.
